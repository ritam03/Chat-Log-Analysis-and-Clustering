# Chat Log Analysis and Clustering

This project focuses on analyzing and clustering customer support tweets to uncover patterns in customer queries.

We utilize the **[Customer Support on Twitter dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter)** from Kaggle, which contains a large collection of tweets directed at various companies. The dataset is ideal for studying real-world customer service interactions.

For our analysis, we specifically focus on the **initial tweets** that customers send to initiate conversations, as these messages are most likely to contain the core problem statement.
