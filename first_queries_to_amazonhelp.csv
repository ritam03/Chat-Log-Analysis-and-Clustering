10844,@AmazonHelp I’m concerned about my #PokemonUltraSunMoon order. It hasn’t shipped yet and it was promised for Friday. You have already failed to ship an order on time for me once this year. This one is more urgent. You simply cannot fail me again.
10845,"Hi @AmazonHelp, Around 4pm (UK time) I topped up my account with £1 however 6 hours later and it's still not been added however the £1 has been taken from my bank account - Is there anyway this can be hurried as I need to purchase a few Xmas presents before they go, Thanks"
10846,Weird call with @AmazonHelp today. Package didn’t come. They blamed @123967 - rep tried to say it was wrong address AND both blamed mail man. My address was listed 100% right on tracking. What gives?! Rep promised extra month of Prime for error but I received no confirmation 😡

13704,Super disappointed with @115821 today. An item I wanted was quoted at a certain price and I clicked on it and the price immediately increased by $15. Customs service won’t help. Too bad Amazon doesn’t value the customer @AmazonHelp
13705,"@AmazonHelp I ordered 8 DVDs, your Kentucky fulfillment center threw them into a 13x18"" envelope instead of a box to let them get bounced around and crushed on the way. I got an envelope full of plastic chunks and loose discs. Online and telephone customer service was useless. 😡"

13713,@AmazonHelp any reason why I can get to my PDF bill from the iOS app? I think by now you have the info of how many people use your mobile app do it should be features equivalent with the web app.

13724,"Man, I thought the @115821 @AmazonHelp 3rd party seller email SPAM for reviews was bad.  Now I just got a SMS from a 3rd party seller asking for a review behind a shortened URL.  @115821, what are you doing to protect our personal information from misuse?"
13725,@AmazonHelp Do any people actually work there or is it all bots and canned responses?  I guess it cuts down on the overhead.  I don’t know why I expected anything different from Amazon.

13965,@115830 when will you learn to deliver packages correctly! To find the parcel has clearly been thrown over the fence and has now broken the candle! @AmazonHelp this is the 3rd time this has been done! https://t.co/GdE4hawKMS
13966,"@AmazonHelp hi, I have been charged £7.99 for Amazon U.K. Prime on the 8th November, I didn't make this transaction and it isn't showing up on my Amazon account.  Please help"
13967,@AmazonHelp can you help me out with some questions I have about echo plus. Can you DM me please.
13968,"Never realised @AmazonHelp customer service is extremely poor in its service, rep has left me on hold for 22 minutes. Not sure if she is going to bother!!! 😂😂"
13969,I have never had a single package delivered on time when it's sent AMZL. what's up with that @115821 @AmazonHelp
13970,.@AmazonHelp Is the two-day ETA on Prime orders just a Black Friday thing or ongoing?
13971,@AmazonHelp I want to know if I want return an item who will pay the cost for return shipping
13972,"@AmazonHelp Hello, I ordered an item from you fro collection at a locker - but I have only recieved an empty cardboard sleeve. Can you help?"
13973,"When you pay extra for @AmazonHelp Prime next day shipping, and now that item is coming later than the rest of your order."
13974,@AmazonHelp when signing up for prime there was no option for monthly pay so I changed it after but the yearly charge still went out. How long does it take for the refund?
13975,"You know what's really creepy @AmazonHelp? Hearing someone try to open your front door, and upon finding it locked knocking... Why do your couriers always try to open the door and dump the package?!"
13976,@AmazonHelp Why doesn't the @115833 have recurring reminders? That seems like a real easy real useful feature.
13977,"Hey @AmazonHelp yesterday and today when I’ve tried to log in or reset my password the website says I don’t have an account and I definitely do. And when I try to go to customer support I have to log in to get there, which if I could do I wouldn’t have to go to customer support."
13978,Back dealing with @AmazonHelp customer service and it still sucks. Not even worth buying from them.
13979,"@AmazonHelp hello, it seems that the code generator is not working. Trying to reset my password and hitting a wall. Can you help ?"
13980,"@115851 i know you probably will never read this but in the last month or so ur Prime membership has failed to deliver within the ""guaranteed"" time..kinda makes me think twice if having Prime is even worth it anymore @AmazonHelp #changeisalwaysgood no prime will teach patience"
13981,@AmazonHelp Order #237316750217 can the dlvry slot be changed to 5-7 Pm? The delivery guy went back as no one is at home at this time.
13982,@AmazonHelp absolutely appalling. Package delivered to a “neighbour.” ParcelForce advised seller to make a claim and snd replacement.Told Amazon who refuse to issue refund saying the package was “delivered” even though it was clearly not to my address #needhelp #CustomerService
13983,"Hi @AmazonHelp if a seller wants a photo of a damaged item I’ve received, how does this work? There seems to be no way to add one on the messaging system."
13984,.@115830 @AmazonHelp Really Amazon? Was this box necessary? A 12 inch rule in a 4ft box! This cost me an additional €14.95 in shipping costs &amp; you sent me the wrong product. Not impressed. How can we sort this? https://t.co/be1QnBaZmX
13985,"I don't have a ""safe place"" set.. especially when it's raining and i order electronics 🙄🙄 @AmazonHelp https://t.co/DlxJQhPaTm"

13987,@115830 @AmazonHelp @115821 not the ideal condition for a ‘brand new’ item to arrive in... https://t.co/F0O28gGalT
13988,"@AmazonHelp 4 of us in the office had an email yesterday saying you tried to deliver our parcel but couldn’t ... when we were all sat in the office with no delivery attempt made. Now, it’s out for delivery today to be with us by 8pm (we don’t work until 8pm) What’s happened?"
13989,@AmazonHelp I’ve got 3 orders on my account that I haven’t ordered or purchased but it won’t let me cancel them? How do I cancel them?
13990,"@115821 @AmazonHelp You DESPERATELY need to do something about your Amazon Logistics drivers. In the past week I have had 3 different items from 3 different orders, not show up. And the only item that I HAVE received was thrown and hit my door. This is WHOLLY UNACCEPTABLE. #FixIt"
13991,@AmazonHelp Paid extra for one-day shipping for pump parts &amp; they're still not here. 🙁 This was a highly time-sensitive purchase! https://t.co/A3x74cXzON
13992,@AmazonHelp @115830 I’m looking for the complete blu ray box set of Dexter but can only see an Italian import version on your site - product information says language is Italian! I’m here in West Sussex and don’t speak Italian 😂 Help!
13993,@AmazonHelp why was I not made aware that my parcel has been returned to the sender?
13994,"@AmazonHelp Hi, do you charge for missed AmazonFresh deliveries in the UK?"
13995,"@AmazonHelp I have just had a delivery from you! And your driver burst into my office, chucked the parcel on the desk! And stormed out! Do you not train your drivers in the art of customer service??"

13998,@AmazonHelp Item missing from my order. Yet online status says all delivered. Not very good. Help.

14016,"@AmazonHelp 5th order in a row for the delivery to be delayed.  Needless to say I am getting VERY frustrated, especially considering I live less than 10 miles from the distribution center that they are being shipped from.  And it is not an inventory problem, order ships and then."

14053,"@115830, @AmazonHelp, @115821. You guys definitely win the “worst customer support” of the year. I am a Prime member and I’m definitely recommending people to stay away from you. Again, worst service ever! 😕"

14170,"... Checked the Amazon app - there was a photo of our box on the porch of a house down the street - with a message claiming *I* had signed for the package. Went to the house, no one was there but luckily the box was. Short version @AmazonHelp -- your delivery person lies"

14201,"Seriously, @AmazonHelp, why am I even paying for Prime? Saying “we’re sorry your package will be late” doesn’t really fix anything. https://t.co/b1nceQMfdN"

14205,@AmazonHelp @UPSHelp You should BOTH be fucking ashamed of your delivery service. Package has been on the truck 2 DAYS IN A ROW. And 2 days in a row its SENT BACK TO THE FUCKING HUB. How difficult is it to deliver a package? Why do I pay for next day shipping if you cant deliver?
14206,"@AmazonHelp Did you stop guaranteeing 2 day shipping? If so, it’s not worth it to have prime. Three orders in one week that are delayed because they are delivered by personal drivers. I might be shopping somewhere else for Christmas."
14207,@AmazonHelp @115821 your call center ppl don't speak enough English to understand that you packed parts of 3 orders in a box then put the wrong shipping label and I got 2 items I didn't order instead of the 4 I did

15809,"@AmazonHelp I ordered a case of wine on a black friday deal, it was due to be delivered on Thursday. I was on Thursday told there would be a delay. Now it shows as undeliverable. But I have had no email to tell me what is going on."

15811,@AmazonHelp Hello! I am not able to access help - I want to chat about an order. Problems?
15812,@AmazonHelp @115850 @117634 Pay balance load not updated even after 15 minutes. Upset.
15813,"@115830 @AmazonHelp service is absolutely shocking! This is now twice my parcels say they have been ""delivered"" but haven't! When I call up the advisers cannot understand what I'm saying and seem incompetent. I pay for a Prime membership too! 😡 fuming"
15814,@AmazonHelp i clicked for an amazon prime free 30 day trial but it seems to have now put my account onto a full prime membership. Please could you advise how i can cancel this as it doesnt give me an option on my account...
15815,@AmazonHelp is there an incognito mode?? I share a mn acct w my hubs and it’s so hard to hid x mas presents!
15816,@AmazonHelp at  it again I hate calling your call centres RUDE AND DONT LISTEN when I am paying for a service I don't expect the phone to be put down on me when it's a problem at your end not mine
15817,@AmazonHelp love to return home to find our moisture sensitive package left on the street (of a busy town) soaking wet. Well done 👏
15818,"When someone asks you a question, giving an answer is the bestbthimg to do instead of apologizing and walking around the question. @AmazonHelp #customerservicenightmare"
15819,"@AmazonHelp Could we have an actual discussion about helping me with my issue, instead of dismissing and muting me? I've tried to be respectful, I don't feel I'm getting the same treatment, in return."
15820,@AmazonHelp Amazon delivered my package to the wrong address.  They replaced the item but now want me to send back the original that I never got.  What do I do?
15821,"@AmazonHelp 
not very impressed. Just received an email saying ‘failed delivery attempt’ as I wasn’t in. 
Well I’ve been here all afternoon and evening waiting and no one knocked or rang door bell. 
Poor service."
15822,@115830 @AmazonHelp desperately waiting for Amazon key now to avoid this. Not ideal. Contents were not damaged. https://t.co/ybXfBsra7G
15823,@AmazonHelp Hello. If I cancel an order that was back ordered and you've taken the money from my account. How long do refunds take?
15824,@AmazonHelp ordered arrived and went to pick it up and someone had already opened it. Nothing inside. What can we do?
15825,@115851 @115821 @AmazonHelp dears I ordered 7 items last Wednesday all in stock when following up on shipping I noticed 4 weren't shipped although checking stock they were in stock now customer service are rude about me asking about my order which I was charged  this not good https://t.co/yVPV57o0c0
15826,"Also it would be nice to have an ""end chat"" button so that when I get an incompetent customer service rep that I could get another one @AmazonHelp"
15827,"@AmazonHelp being a prime member, it's really upsetting to experience terrible delivery service from #Amazon who leave packages unattended in the lobby and say it's ""DELIVERED"" when they actually are not! And then say they can't help!

ARE YOU KIDDING ME???"
15828,"@AmazonHelp i love how i ordered something on Thursday, paid for 2-day shipping, and it still isn’t here, on a Sunday, 4 days later."
15829,"@AmazonHelp hi, I ordered and item and I have received 2 but they have come from separate places? Is there any chance u could explain what’s happened?"
15830,@AmazonHelp I have not received an order. It’s 2 weeks late and I’m having no luck with contacting the seller. Can you help please?
15831,Bonjour @AmazonHelp it seems you could help me to find if one of your delivery man visit my building on the 30th of november. Tks https://t.co/S1BGJNEafD
15832,"@AmazonHelp my tracking is saying that you delivered a package to me at 7.01pm ""handed to resident"". Not here it wasn't because I wasn't home. Would love to know which resident it was handed to so I can get it back."
15833,@115830 @AmazonHelp hi i got a free 30 day trial card in the post but when i go to the website given i dont see an option to use this. can someone help me? the letter doesnt really give any instruction
15834,"@AmazonHelp I've waited all day for my parcel and no delivery, what is the point of having Prime membership if you are not able to fulfil it"
15835,@AmazonHelp i ordered a torch and selected one day shipping instead of two day but it still shows tuesday instead of monday
15836,"@AmazonHelp why even use usps, when they are constantly unreliable and late? Is there even a point to prime anymore, when packages are always late? https://t.co/jELKNW9kx1"
15837,"@AmazonHelp Hello! I have a Chromecast. If I sign up for Amazon Prime, will I be able to cast videos?"
15838,@AmazonHelp hey appear to have been charged for prime? Never used that service and haven’t bought anything from you in a year?
15839,"@AmazonHelp I ordered an elgato and it hasn’t shipped yet, how long until I get it? https://t.co/z4MqdlnqIK"
15840,Hey @AmazonHelp where's my delivery you said you would deliver between 7am - 10pm #amazon #amazonprime #amazonfailed
15841,@AmazonHelp wanted to let you know that I was just hung up on TWICE by your Logistics supervisors. It’s really awesome to be a Prime member these days and get consistent delays on pacakages and absolutely no help from your customer service line.
15842,@AmazonHelp @115821 gonna start using @115937 for Christmas shopping since they deliver when they say they will. My parents have had 6 deliveries marked as undeliverable #unacceptable #poorcustomerservice
15843,@AmazonHelp You should stop that open delivery thing. You have no right to unbox our package even if cost more than a lakh. This is not done. Flipkart is good at this.
